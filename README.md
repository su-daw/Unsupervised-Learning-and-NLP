#### Project Motivation
Yelp is one of the most popular apps for finding new places. It also offers reviews and recommendations of restaurants, cafes, entertainment, activities, services, and more. Natural Language Processing is being used to build a system that can detect the sentiments in cafe reviews. This system can help cafes determine which aspects are positive and which are negative, so they can make improvements. In addition, build a recommendation system that shows similar cafes based on the customer's preferences.

#### Our Achieved Result

- Topic Modelling
  - Topic one: talks about <strong> Place </strong>
  - Topic two: talks about <strong> Service </strong>
  - Topic three: talks about <strong> Food </strong>

- Sentiment Analysis
  - The following figure shows that most of the cafe's sentments are positive.
